- How to instantiate a model (2 ways)
- How to build a layer
- How to add regularization to a layer
- How to add dropout to a layer
- How to add batch normalization
- How to compile a model
- How to optimize a model
- How to fit a model
- How to use validation data
- How to perform early stopping
- How to measure accuracy
- How to evaluate a model
- How to make a prediction with a model
- How to access the weights/outputs of a model
- What is HDF5?
- How to save and load a model’s weights, a model’s configuration, and the entire model

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.5)
- Your files will be executed with `numpy` (version 1.15) and tensorflow (version 1.12)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All of your files must be executable
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.4)
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print\
(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import `import tensorflow.keras as K`
