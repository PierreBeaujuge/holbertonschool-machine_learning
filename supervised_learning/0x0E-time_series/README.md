# 0x0E. Time Series Forecasting

## This project was summarized in a Medium article (follow the link!):
### ["Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with a Bidirectional LSTM: Building a Model Geared to Multiple Input Series"](https://medium.com/@pierre.beaujuge/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-with-a-bidirectional-lstm-building-a-model-geared-to-4f020a160636)

## Learning Objectives

- What is time series forecasting?
- What is a stationary process?
- What is a sliding window?
- How to preprocess time series data
- How to create a data pipeline in tensorflow for time series data
- How to perform time series forecasting with RNNs in tensorflow

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.5)
- Your files will be executed with `numpy` (version 1.15) and `tensorflow` (version 1.12)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All of your files must be executable
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.4)
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print\
(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
