# 0x05. Advanced Linear Algebra

## Learning Objectives

- Compute determinants
- What is a minor, cofactor, adjugate? How would you calculate them?
- What is an inverse? How would you calculate it?
- What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors? How would you calculate them?
- What is definiteness of a matrix? How would you determine a matrixâ€™s definiteness?

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.5)
- Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All of your files must be executable
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.4)
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print\
(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
