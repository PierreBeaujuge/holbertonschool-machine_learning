# 0x03. Hyperparameter Tuning

## This project was summarized in a Medium article (follow the link!):
### ["Bayesian Optimization on the Head Classifier of Pre-Trained CNNs Using the CIFAR10 Dataset: Transfer Learning 'Upgraded'"](https://medium.com/@pierre.beaujuge/bayesian-optimization-on-the-head-classifier-of-pre-trained-cnns-using-the-cifar10-dataset-48c440b67b2c)

## Learning Objectives

- What is Hyperparameter Tuning?
- What is random search? grid search?
- What is a Gaussian Process?
- What is a mean function?
- What is a Kernel function?
- What is Gaussian Process Regression/Kriging?
- What is Bayesian Optimization?
- What is an Acquisition function?
- What is Expected Improvement?
- What is Knowledge Gradient?
- What is Entropy Search/Predictive Entropy Search?
- What is GPy?
- What is GPyOpt?

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.5)
- Your files will be executed with `numpy` (version 1.15)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All of your files must be executable
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.4)
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print\
(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except `import numpy as np`
